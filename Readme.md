I tend to set up my systems in similar ways - The scripts and documentation here are what I use to get my windows systems up and running quickly. 
A cloud/syncable password manager is useful, I simply use my web browser's password system for this but otherwise this is (nearly!) all I need.

As far as possible, initial installation is done via Chocolatey - I have a small batch file that bootstraps that.

I've done some initial discovery on winget - there's a few blockers, especially the inability to batch up installs, but I'll be looking at moving to it in the future

I also use an [IODD](http://iodd.kr/wordpress/) external HDD - so most of my installs are done via ISOs [https://gist.github.com/AveYo/c74dc774a8fb81a332b5d65613187b15](https://gist.github.com/AveYo/c74dc774a8fb81a332b5d65613187b15) 
seems a very nice tool to get them.
