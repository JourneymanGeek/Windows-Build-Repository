------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The base install *does* have some personal preferences 

 paint.net - My 'preferred' image editor, and the only one I'm any good at
 powertoys - mainly for the 'image resize' powertoy
 eartrumpet - a 'better' audio mixer, lets you move audio sources between outputs, which is awesome if you have multiple sound outputs
 mobaxterm - a better SSH client on windows - though I might move to windows terminal and the built in SSH client on windows 10 + 
 microsoft-windows-terminal - a better terminal on windows. Might become standard on 11
 sumatrapdf - my favoured PDF and ebook reader
 sublimetext4 - my favoured text editor
 vivaldi.install - my preferred browser. The choco repo has an older version and there's a broken repo that's supposed to have the 4x branch, but I just let it update
 sourcecodepro - preferred monospace font
 7zip - tends to handle nearly all compression formats so its useful to have 
 
 Util
 choco-package-list-backup Backs up the package list if reinstall is needed 
 choco-cleaner cleaning download caches is a premium feature on choco... this does this 
 
media
mp3tag - My preferred mp3 management tool - I use this to have a fairly consistant folder/tagging system for my music 
mpc-be - I was running MPC-HC for years, and this seems the supported replacement. Its just a little nicer and more flexible than the stock apps. In theory VLC also works
foobar2000 - Music player of choice 
 
Chat
ripcord - reasonably nice (though odd to set up due to no fault of its own) slack/discord client. Shareware
element-desktop - I use matrix for quite a few things - this is the reference client

Peripherals - not even sure why this is here :D. VERY specific to what one uses, I happen to run nvidia cards and often razer hardware. There's seperate choco packages for synapse 2 and 3

geforce-experience - geforce/nvidia drives
razer-synapse-3 - Razer Drivers

Optional
veeam-agent - while my current builds are increasingly 'disposable', Its a nice. trustworthy backup method. I don't have them on current builds
cyberduck - My SFTP client of choice, where needed. 

Gaming - Various gaming clients. 
epicgameslauncher 
steam
